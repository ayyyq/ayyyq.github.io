<!-- ## About Me -->
I am an incoming Ph.D. student at USC to be advised by Prof. [Robin Jia](https://robinjia.github.io/). Currently, I am interning at GAIR Lab, woking with my amazing advisor, Prof. [Pengfei Liu](https://plms.ai/people/index.html). During my intership, I have been very fortunate to receive mentoring from Prof. [Graham Neubig](https://www.phontron.com/) for a period. I received my master's degree at Fudan Univeristy, advised by [Xipeng Qiu](https://xpqiu.github.io/). Before joining Fudan, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2021.

My primary research interests revolve around LLM alignment, with a particular focus on issues related to LLM knowledge and reasoning. Previously, I worked in the area of Information Extraction.
